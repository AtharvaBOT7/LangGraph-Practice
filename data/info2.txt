Llama 4, released in April 2025 by Meta, represents a major leap in large language model design through its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which balances efficiency, scale, and multimodal capability. The model lineup includes Llama 4 Scout, a lightweight 17B active parameter model with 16 experts and an industry-leading 10M token context window that runs on a single Nvidia H100 GPU; Llama 4 Maverick, a more robust 17B active parameter model with 128 experts and a 1M token context window designed to challenge GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash; and Llama 4 Behemoth, currently in training, which scales to 288B active parameters and ~2T total parameters with the goal of surpassing GPT-4.5 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 in STEM reasoning benchmarks. Beyond sheer scale, Llama 4 is multimodal—supporting both text and image inputs with text/code outputs—and multilingual, trained on ~200 languages and optimized for 12 major ones, enabling use cases in vision tasks such as captioning, Q&A, and assistant-style interaction. Meta has also improved governance, reducing refusals of political or contentious questions from 7% in Llama 3.3 to under 2%, signaling stronger alignment and balanced responses. Benchmark results show Scout outperforming Gemma 3 and Mistral 3.1 in efficiency, Maverick rivaling premium closed-source models on reasoning and coding, and Behemoth expected to dominate STEM benchmarks upon release. Strategically, Llama 4 is embedded across Meta’s ecosystem—including WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram Direct, and the web—supported by Superintelligence Labs and billions in AI investment, while being positioned as a cornerstone of open-weight AI leadership. Although some critics noted gaps in reasoning-focused models during the LlamaCon 2025 launch, Llama 4 overall embodies Meta’s ambition to deliver high-context, cost-effective, globally scalable AI systems that blend innovation, accessibility, and responsible deployment.
