       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'data/info3.txt'}, page_content='India’s economy in 2025 stands as one of the fastest growing in the world, projected at approximately $4.2 trillion in nominal GDP and maintaining an annual growth rate of 6.3% to 6.5%, making it the fourth largest globally in nominal terms and the third largest in purchasing power parity. This momentum is driven by robust domestic consumption, rising foreign direct investment, government-backed infrastructure programs, and the increasing digitization of both urban and rural sectors. Major initiatives such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline and the PM Gati Shakti masterplan are catalyzing manufacturing growth, logistics optimization, and multimodal connectivity across the country, while the Union Budget 2025 has introduced sweeping tax changes, including zero income tax up to ₹12 lakh (₹12.75 lakh with standard deduction), increased TDS thresholds, and longer filing windows to enhance compliance ease. Alongside these direct tax reforms, the most transformative fiscal step of 2025 has been the rollout of GST 2.0, a landmark overhaul that collapsed the earlier complex four-slab structure into two simplified slabs of 5% and 18%, coupled with a 40% “sin tax” on luxury items and socially harmful goods. Essential commodities such as daily food staples, life-saving medicines, insurance, and health-related services have been exempted from GST, thereby reducing the cost burden on households, while mass-market categories like small cars, electronic appliances, and consumer goods have seen substantial tax reductions. Conversely, higher rates have been levied on carbonated beverages, tobacco, and other sin products to balance fiscal revenue. Effective from 22 September 2025, the reform is expected to stimulate domestic demand, drive higher consumption in automotive, consumer durables, and retail segments, and streamline compliance by reducing classification disputes that plagued the previous GST structure. Analysts forecast that despite an estimated ₹48,000 crore near-term revenue shortfall for the government, the long-term impact of GST 2.0 will add 100 to 120 basis points to GDP growth through multiplier effects, widening the tax base, and boosting formalization in sectors that previously struggled with tax evasion. International observers including the OECD, IMF, and World Bank have reaffirmed India’s position as the fastest-growing major economy, even amidst global economic headwinds, tightening monetary policies in advanced economies, and volatile energy markets. Meanwhile, capital expenditure on roads, railways, ports, and renewable energy continues to attract foreign institutional investors, supported by India’s stable macroeconomic fundamentals and strong consumer market of over 1.4 billion people. The financial markets responded positively to GST 2.0 and Union Budget reforms, with indices for auto, FMCG, and electronics companies witnessing strong rallies, signaling investor confidence in a consumption-led growth story. At the same time, these reforms are being positioned as a strategic counterweight to external challenges, including rising global tariffs, with India leveraging domestic reforms to safeguard growth and maintain competitiveness. Collectively, these measures reflect a broader policy shift toward simplifying the tax regime, boosting compliance, empowering the middle class, and enhancing India’s global investment appeal, positioning the Indian economy not only as resilient in the face of global uncertainty but also as a transformative growth engine for the decade ahead.')]"
